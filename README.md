## üìñ Project Overview  
This project focused on automating and scaling the retrieval of academic journal articles related to **obesity and diabetes research**.  

By building a **scalable scraping pipeline**, I enabled **daily ingestion** of research publications across multiple sources. The pipeline expanded acquisition volume from **100 articles to 1,500 per week (15√ó increase)** while **reducing subscription costs by 95%**.  

This system provided an efficient and cost-effective way to keep research teams continuously updated with the latest scientific findings.  

## ‚ú® Key Highlights  
- **Automated daily scraping** of obesity- and diabetes-related journal articles.  
- **Scalable pipeline** expanded retrieval from **100 ‚Üí 1,500 articles per week (15√ó increase)**.  
- **Reduced subscription costs by 95%** by eliminating dependency on paid aggregation services.  
- **Streamlined research workflows**, ensuring timely access to cutting-edge clinical findings.  
- Enabled **faster insights** by ensuring researchers had **daily access** to new publications.
